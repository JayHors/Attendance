# Attendance
QR code-based attendance system, built for use in CSH.

# The Plan
I plan on building an admin page for directorships to use for checking attendance during house meeting or directorship meetings. The initial focus will be on house meetings, but once I have that down, it should be relatively easy to port over for use during directorship meetings. 
- Admins will be able to generate a QR code for users to scan with a client
- Users will log in via SSO and be able to scan a generated QR code to get attendance
- Admins will be able to get statistics of any particular attendance, such as to see if we meet quorum for a particular vote in house
- Automatic conditional integration?
